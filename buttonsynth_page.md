## "BUTTON" SYNTHESIZER

**Project Description:** "Button" synthesizer is an instrument that allows you to modify pitch by tapping on the cushion. The buttons are sewn with conductive thread.
Your skin is considered a variable resistor, therefore, by making a connection between the threads, you are changing the pitch of each pot (potentiometer).
The cushions are hand-sewed by me and all components including the circuit board, the pitch control board, the battery, and the 4 cushions are stored in a clear case with a handle.
