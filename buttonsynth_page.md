**Project Description:**
<br>
The "Button" synthesizer is an instrument that allows you to modify the pitch by tapping on its cushioned surface. The buttons are stitched with conductive thread. 

Your skin acts as a variable resistor; by creating a connection between the threads, you can change the pitch for each potentiometer or knob.

I hand-sew the cushions with various characters. All components, including the circuit board, pitch control board, battery, and four cushions, are stored in a clear case with a handle for easy transport.
