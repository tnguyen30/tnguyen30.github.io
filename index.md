This is my very first sound design project. The music was composed by me using a virtual keyboard. The voice actors were myself, [Hayley Tran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayley-tran-342125186/), and Taichi Kobayashi. It was recorded using Tascam DR-40X portable recorder. The short horror film "Bedfellows" was released in 2009 and was directed by Drew Daywalt. It also won the Chiller-Eyegore Award for Best Short Film in 2009. This is certainly not a perfect project, but I had a great time working on it.

"Soulbot" is a sound design project for a commercial video called "SoulBot". The music was from Apple Live Loops and was put together on Logic Pro. Most sound effects were collected from freesound.org. The whole project was edited on Pro Tools. The most challenging part while working on this project was that making sure the sound effects of the robots' arms are in sync with the video.
