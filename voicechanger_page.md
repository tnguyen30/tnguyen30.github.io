## THE VOICE CHANGER MASK

**Project description:** This is a prototype of a voice-changing mask that enables users to modify their voice into a robotic tone in real-time. The primary purpose of the mask is to minimize the user's original voice, making the modulated voice clearer to others. Additionally, the mask can be redesigned to fit a robot head costume, if desired.

### 1. The mask design

<br>
The mask was originally designed by Let's Print. It was 3D-printed using a MakerBot Replicator Z18. A loudspeaker was hot-glued to the front, and two rubber bands were attached to the sides. In the second photo, you can see a piece of wood taped between the speaker and the microphone. This was necessary because they were placed too close to each other, which caused feedback.

### 2. The PCB

<br>
I created the PCB using the datasheet provided by [Jameco Electronics](https://www.jameco.com/). I utilized [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) to design the board and placed an order with [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) for manufacturing. The PCB was then sewn into a small wallet that accommodates a 9-volt battery. You can easily clip the wallet onto your belt or waistband for convenience.
