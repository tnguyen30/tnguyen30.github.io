**Project description:** This is a prototype of a voice changer mask that allows user to change their voice into a robot in real-time.

### 1. The mask design

<br>
The mask was originally designed by Let's Print. It was 3D-printed using MakerBot Replicator Z18, the louspeaker was hot glued to the front, and two rubber bands were attached to the sides. In the picture on the right, you can see there's a piece of wood taped between the speaker and the microphone that's because they were placed too closed to each other which causing feedback.

### 2. The PCB

I designed the PCB based on the data sheet that provided by [Jameco Electronics](https://www.jameco.com/). I used [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) to design the board and ordered it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). The PCB was sewed to a small wallet, which stored a 9-volt battery. You can clip the wallet on yor belt or waistband.

### 3. Demonstration

### 4. Next step

The mask is definitely needed to be redesigned to separate the speaker and the mic so they won't cause feedback. Another solution is that we can design a custom mask such as a robot mask for Halloween, which would be a fun experiment.
